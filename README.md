# Project Diana

Project Diana is a "new" Minecraft modpack for 1.7.10.

It is somewhat a fork of [Project Ozone 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/project-ozone-2-reloaded). To start with, much of the config and recipes
are a direct fork of PO2, however this isn't intended to **JUST** be a PO2 update, it is more of a spiritual successor and an attempt to breathe new life into Skyblock on Minecraft 1.7.10.

Here are the major differences from Project Ozone so far, though there will be more to come:

* Runs on modern Java 17+ thanks to [lwjgl3ify](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/lwjgl3ify).
* No game modes, only includes a spiritual successor to Kappa mode, perhaps in the future we can maintain more.
* Some mods are missing or replaced by alternatives due to not having compatible versions or ability to fork custom versions.
* Many mods have been replaced by new versions which are maintained by [GTNH](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons) or by the Project Diana team. Meaning there are MANY QoL and security fixes included. As an example, the version of NEI in this pack has many of the new features you'd find in JEI like bookmarks, creative style tabs, and significantly improved search performance and recipe loading.

## Installation

The recommended way to play the pack is via the [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/). It should work fine in MultiMC or Poly, but may need manual tweaks due to running with Java 17+.

**NOTE:** 6GB of RAM is recommended

The latest version of the pack can be downloaded from the Releases on GitHub and imported directly into Prism. The server version of the pack can also be downloaded from the Releases on Github.

To run a server, simply run the included `start.bat` or `start.sh` script in the server pack, depending on your platform(Windows or Linux).
