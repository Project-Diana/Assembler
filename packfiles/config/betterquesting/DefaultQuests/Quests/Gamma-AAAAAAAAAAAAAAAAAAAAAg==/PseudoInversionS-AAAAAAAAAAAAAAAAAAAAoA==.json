      "desc:8": "After being activated once, the Division Sigil can be activated again to transform into a Pseudo-Inversion Sigil, a ritual significantly more complicated than the first activation, which can only be performed in the End dimension. It is highly advised to defeat the Dragon prior to starting the ritual, but not necessary. The ritual is performed by placing a Beacon in the centre of a flat area of at least 11ï¿½11, not necessarily on End Stone, then place a chest in each of the cardinal directions leaving 4 spaces empty between the chest and the Beacon.                                  A spiral pattern of Redstone and String is then laid out around the beacon. At any time, Shift+Right-clicking the Beacon with an Activated Division Sigil in hand will show the building progress of the ritual. Finally, kill an Iron Golem while it stands within the ritual area to activate the process. If it works, there will be an explosion that destroys the beacon and chests, while every Enderman in the End vanishes. During the ritual, throngs of aggresive mobs imbued with Haste will begin spawning and attacking the Player who needs to kill a 100 of them to complete the ritual. If the Player dies or leave the dimension, the ritual will fail and will have to be started over. Once enough mobs have been killed, the first activated Sigil in the inventory will stabilize. The Pseudo-Inversion Sigil can be used an unlimited number of times, and dividing an Iron Ingot by Diamond will produce Mobius \"Unstable-Stable\" Ingot which does not explode, can be produced in any crafting interface and will stack up to 64."
